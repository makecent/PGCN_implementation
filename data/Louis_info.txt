The three files dfmad_test_prop_dict.pkl ... are produced by PGCN after training. And they will be stored for next training. So if you just debug a problem, remember to delete the generated dick.pkl files because they may still old one that making bugs.

In the dataset_cfg.yaml, there is dfmad configs (scroll down to see)

Every run will save the whole runtime code and files thus will consume larger size of memory, remember to delete fail runs in work_dirs.

I meet the cuda assert error, which is found to be caused by error label in the proposal.txt files.
